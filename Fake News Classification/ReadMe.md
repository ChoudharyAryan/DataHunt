# Fake News Detection using Python and Machine Learning

## Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a Fake News Detection project. The project's aim is to build a machine learning model that can classify news articles as either real or fake. It involves data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, and evaluation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for code exploration)

You can install the necessary Python libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn nltk
```

## Data

The project relies on a dataset of labeled news articles. You can obtain such a dataset from various sources, or you can create your own. Ensure that the dataset is divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is an essential step. It involves tasks like:

- Text cleaning: removing punctuation, lowercasing, etc.
- Tokenization: splitting text into words or tokens.
- Removing stopwords: common words that don't carry much meaning.
- Vectorization: converting text data into numerical format (e.g., TF-IDF or word embeddings).

## Feature Engineering

Feature engineering can include creating additional features from the text data or using pre-trained word embeddings. This step is crucial for improving the model's performance.

## Machine Learning Model

You can use various machine learning algorithms for this project, such as:

- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machine
- Deep Learning (e.g., using TensorFlow or PyTorch)

You should train and evaluate multiple models to find the best-performing one.

## Model Evaluation

Model evaluation is crucial to determine how well your model is performing. Common evaluation metrics for binary classification include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC AUC.

## Usage

To train and evaluate the model, you can use the provided Jupyter Notebook or run Python scripts. Make sure to split the data into training and testing sets and save the trained model for future use.

## Conclusion

Fake News Detection is a critical task in today's information age. This project showcases how machine learning can be used to distinguish real and fake news articles. You can further enhance the model's performance by experimenting with different algorithms and feature engineering techniques.
