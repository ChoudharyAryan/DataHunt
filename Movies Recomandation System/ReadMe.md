# Movie Recommendation System README

This Python script is a basic movie recommendation system. It uses the TF-IDF vectorizer to convert text data related to movies into feature vectors and then computes cosine similarity between movies to make recommendations.

## Getting Started

To run this code, you will need to have Python and the required libraries installed. You can install the necessary libraries using the following:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Clone the repository or download the code.
Make sure you have a CSV file named movies.csv in the ../input/movies/ directory. The CSV file should contain information about movies.
Run the Python script.
You can input your favorite movie, and the script will recommend similar movies based on the movie's plot, cast, director, etc.

Example
bash
Enter your favorite movie name: Spider-Man 3
The code will recommend movies that are similar to "Spider-Man 3."
