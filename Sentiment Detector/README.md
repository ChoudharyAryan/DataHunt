# Sentiment Analysis

This project implements a sentiment analysis model that evaluates the sentiment of movie reviews, categorizing them as either positive or negative. The model is trained on a dataset of labeled movie reviews from IMDb.

## Dataset

The sentiment analysis model is trained on the IMDb movie reviews dataset. It comprises movie reviews along with their respective sentiment labels (positive or negative). The dataset is stored in the file `imdb_dataset.csv`. Ensure that you place the dataset file in the same directory as the code.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- wordcloud

You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn wordcloud
```

## Usage

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TheNaiveSamosa/ProjectArena-ML/tree/main
cd ProjectArena-ML
```

2. **Place the Dataset**:

   Place the `imdb_dataset.csv` file in the same directory as the code.

3. **Run the `sentiment_analysis.py` Script**:

```bash
python sentiment_analysis.py
```

4. The model will be trained on the dataset and will perform sentiment analysis on new text data.

5. The accuracy of the model will be displayed, and you can also test the model on new reviews by modifying the `new_reviews` list in the code.

## Results

The sentiment analysis model achieves an accuracy of approximately 85% on the test set. The model effectively categorizes text data into positive and negative sentiment categories.

## Future Improvements

- Explore different feature extraction techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to enhance the model's performance.
- Experiment with various machine learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or neural networks.
- Increase the size of the training dataset to improve the model's generalization ability.
- Implement a web interface or API for easy interaction with the sentiment analysis model.
